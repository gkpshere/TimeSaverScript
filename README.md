# TimeSaverScript
Simple Python script to keep screenactive.

If anybody is reading this out there !! This is for your information. :)

This is a python script I use to keep my screenactive whenever I take a break from my system.
It saves me a lot of time, I don't have to come back and login everytime.


Happy coding in Python!
